I"Ã<h5>What makes me stand out ?</h5>
<p>Iâ€™m obsessed in both taking the best pictures along with making you really
enjoying the photo shooting. Customer service, responsiveness and dedication are
really important to me. Headshot sessions can be done in studio or outside with
studio quality lighting.</p>
<h5>What makes A Great Headshot ?</h5>
<p>Thereâ€™s a lot that goes into making a great headshot but I think it starts with
a good talk. A headshot is a way to make a great first impression and connect
with your customers or target audience. It should capture your own personality,
character and style. It should highlight your confidence and make you stand out.</p>
<h5>Why do you need a Headshot ?</h5>
<p>Headshots are everywhere in this day and age. Linkedin profiles, business cards,
marketing materials, websites, company directories, email signatures, press
releases, announcements, campaigns, publications, business or medical residency
applications all require headshots. Even Tinder profiles, Hinge profiles and
other popular dating apps and websites require headshots. There are so many uses
for headshots that we canâ€™t list them all here but suffice to say that you need
a high quality headshot.</p>
